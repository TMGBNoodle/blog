**Lab 10 Reflection**:  
Azure is quite the experience. Pretty much every step of the process involved some issue, as Azure is incredibly finicky. Most of the work was completed by Caden, as we ran the project from his computer, but we ran into a lot of issues that we provided assistance with. This project improved our communication skills immensely. It taught me a lot about how website deployment works, and told me that if I ever go into the field I need to be able to fully understand my software. Whenever we ran into an error it took a long time to even identify the cause.
