## Figuring out style is hard.

(This image is unrelated I was just looking for a fitting image and found this and thought it was really funny)

Markdown is an interesting language. As far as I could find there was no way to directly add style to markdown files with things like classes in html. I think I prefer html if only because it's a lot easier to stray from the things it's specifically designed to do. Perhaps I missed something about markdown. That's possible, and even probable. I did a lot of specific googling to find things like [How to add images in markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41604263/how-do-i-display-local-image-in-markdown). It took me way too long to get the brackets right. I thought it was ["text"]{link} and was having a bit of a breakdown trying to figure out what was wrong.

My biggest struggle was with making changes without breaking everything. I went into the sass files to make a few changes(my background is the change), and it was hard to balance making those changes with not ruining the whole site, and sometimes it took a little work to find the root color values. I did eventually find them through searching the whole project.

Going deep into the records to find the things I need to change:

I'm really looking forwards to creating actual functionality in sites. Toggle switches, databases, and content that actually changes through user input on the websites. We've been doing a lot of website coding but not much function coding. Maybe this isn't something we'll be doing, but even so it'll be cool to work with non-profits to integrate whatever they need into websites. Things like the [Hendrix College Arboretum](https://arboretum.hendrix.edu) would be really interesting to put together.
