## Figuring out style is hard.

(This image is unrelated I was just looking for a fitting image and found this and thought it was really funny)

Markdown is an interesting language. As far as I could find there was no way to directly add style to markdown files with things like classes in html. I think I prefer html if only because it's a lot easier to stray from the things it's specifically designed to do. Perhaps I missed something about markdown. That's possible, and even probable. I did a lot of specific googling to find things like [How to add images in markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41604263/how-do-i-display-local-image-in-markdown). It took me way too long to get the brackets right. I thought it was ["text"]{link} and was having a bit of a breakdown trying to figure out what was wrong.

(My biggest struggle was with making changes without breaking everything. I went into the sass files to make a few changes(my background is the change), and it was hard to balance making those changes with not ruining the whole site, and sometimes it took a little work to find the root color values. I did eventually find them through searching the whole project.) Outdated. I've gone through like 16 different iterations trying to get images to load on git. I've tried everything I can find online and nothing has worked. Even using the autofill referencing the images won't load. Not sure what to do. Submitting for now, will ask questions next class to try to figure it out.

Going deep into the records:

I'm really looking forwards to creating actual functionality in sites. Toggle switches, databases, and content that actually changes through user input on the websites. We've been doing a lot of website coding but not much function coding. Maybe this isn't something we'll be doing, but even so it'll be cool to work with non-profits to integrate whatever they need into websites. Things like the [Hendrix College Arboretum](https://arboretum.hendrix.edu) would be really interesting to put together.
