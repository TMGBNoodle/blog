## Context:

This is for my class at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu). I am taking database and web systems with [Dr. Mark Goadrich](http://mark.goadrich.com). In this class I have been learning things such as:
 - The basics of html
 - Assisting software such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
 - How to properly use version control software such as github and gitkraken.
 - The Evils of rabbits.  

**New Aspects**:  

This is kind of throughout the entire beginning of this class, but version control software like git is not something I'm used to. I've rather enjoyed learning it.   

**Struggles**:  

I'm struggling with figuring out how everything references everything else in this project. I tried to add a social icon to the project but there were multiple places I had to find in order to get it work, and I couldn't locate them all.   

**Things I'm still struggling with**:  

While I did eventually figure out how to use shell, I'd like to be able to use it better. I fumbled around with tutorials instead of really knowing what I was doing.
