## Context:

This is for my class at [Hendrix College](https://www.hendrix.edu). I am taking database and web systems with [Dr. Mark Goadrich](http://mark.goadrich.com). In this class I have been learning things such as:
 - The basics of html
 - Assisting software such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
 - How to properly use version control software such as github and gitkraken.
 - The Evils of rabbits.  

**New Aspects**:  

This is kind of throughout the entire beginning of this class, but version control software like git is not something I'm used to. I've enjoyed challenging myself with it. Ruby wasn't that hard, but I was taught about how sometimes I have to restart my computer for shell to recognize new environment variables like ruby or gem. It's a good thing to know for the future.

**Struggles**:  

I'm struggling with figuring out how everything references everything else in this project. I worry about changing most things that I'm not explicitly told to experiment with, as if somethings breaks I don't have the familiarity with the structure of this project to fix it without just spamming undo(though that is definitely a viable method).

**Things I'm still struggling with**:  

While I did eventually figure out how to use shell, I'd like to be able to use it better. I fumbled around with tutorials instead of really knowing what I was doing. I've definitely picked up a few things, but I can't navigate quite as easily as a linux user might.s
