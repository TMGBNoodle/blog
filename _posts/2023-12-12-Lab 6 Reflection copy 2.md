**Lab 6 Reflection**:  
For my entities, I assumed the presense of the following entities: An Order, an Account, a Final order, and an Item entity. Since the finalized order had different values than than the initial order, I separated them, and using an Order id to fill in the information the initial order already had felt like a more efficient way to set up information. LucidChart was difficult but I ended up completing it despite it's tendency to give all the lines I drew random attributes I didn't want. It was difficult to remember how the lines were supposed to be drawn, so there was a lot of cross referencing, and I may have missed something. I considered adding a store entity that had a list of items, but it felt to me like it was unnecessary, as the website using this model would be the store and it contains the tables.
