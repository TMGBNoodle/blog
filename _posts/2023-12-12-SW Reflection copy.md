**SW Reflection**:  

In the process of developing this website for St. Joseph Bazaar, I have gained a few critical skills. First and foremost is communication. Working with a client to produce a product such as this requires constant questions whenever the opportunity arises, as the entire goal is to provide a product that supports their efforts. Ignoring or marginalizing their input is not only incredibly rude, it produces a much worse result, as this tool that was supposed to be levered to assist others will now likely fail, possibly leaving someone off worse than before. Another very important thing I learned is how much effect small things can have. The need for organization services is a crucial and underrated aspect of our society, and I didn’t realize how much I as a computer science student could offer in this aspect. I never really considered how much computer science could help those who help the world. Perhaps I can’t bring about massive change myself, but I can create and manage the tools of those who can.
