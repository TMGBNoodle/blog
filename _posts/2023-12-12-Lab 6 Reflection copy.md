**Lab 6 Reflection**:  
For my entities, I assumed the presense of the following entities: An Order, an Account, a Final order, and an Item entity. Since the finalized order had different values than than the initial order, I separated them. LucidChart was difficult but I ended up completing it despite it's tendency to give all the lines I drew random attributes I didn't want. It was difficult to remember how the lines were supposed to be drawn.
