**Lab 8 Reflection**:  
Lab 8 was difficult. Specifically the migrations. After making a change I corrupted the model snapshot and had to recreate the project from scratch. This set me back and taught me the importance of backing up my current point within the project. Overall, it was interesting to see how razerpages operated in this instance. Running command prompt commands was rather easy for me due to my doing this late, but my first experience with razerpages and this one have made it clear to me how difficult it is to manage the commands and especially the database, as both are extremely finicky. The version changes made it especially hard to run things.
