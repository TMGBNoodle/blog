**Lab 9 Reflection**:  
Lab 9 was difficult. It's extremely easy for small syntax errors to snowball and disrupt the entire project. Migrations are extremely difficult to manage, as if you haven't set everything up perfectly it can be very difficult to find an error. It is extremely satisfying to see the final changes show up though. I'm pretty against pursuing web design as a career, but the rush I felt when I found the tiny error that was disrupting everything was pretty nice.
